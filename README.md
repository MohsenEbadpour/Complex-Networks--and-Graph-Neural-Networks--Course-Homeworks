# Complex Networks (and Graph Neural Networks) Course Homeworks
Welcome to my Complex Networks (GNN) course homework repository! This repository contains my solutions and implementations of homework assignments from the fall 2022 semester at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT). I had the privilege of learning from Professor Mostafa H. Chehreghani and excelled in the implementation aspect of the course, achieving the highest scores.

## Overview

In this course, I delved into the fascinating world of Complex Networks. I worked on various assignments that enhanced my understanding of graph theory, graph neural networks, graph datasets, graph generation, community detection, influence maximization, outbreak detection, link prediction and etc. The repository showcases my efforts and solutions throughout the semester.

## Course Structure

The Complex Networks course comprised the following components:

- **Homework Assignments**: There were two main homework(project) assignments, each covering different topics and challenges related to Complex Networks and graphs. These assignments helped me develop practical skills in implementing Complex Networks techniques.

- **Final Project**: For my final project in the mentioned course, I undertook the task of implementing and experimenting with new datasets based on the research paper titled "Self-Attention Graph Pooling." This challenging and cutting-edge project involved diving deep into the world of graph neural networks and exploring innovative ways to apply self-attention mechanisms to graph pooling. More details are available on my other repository. 

- **Examinations**: The course included only a final exam to assess my theoretical understanding of the subject.
